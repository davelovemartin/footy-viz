# 4. Use D3

Date: 2021-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Need to create a data visualisation

## Decision

I'm going to use D3 as a utility library for creating the data visualisation
elements.

## Consequences

D3 plays really nicely with React. Although I've not used D3 before, I
understand that it provides a number of powerful functions for mathematical
calculations, manipulating arrays, and dealing with scales.
