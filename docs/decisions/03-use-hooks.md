# 3. Use Hooks

Date: 2021-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Need to manage state.

## Decision

I'm going to Hooks in React.

## Consequences

There's no need for a verbose state management system but if there were a lot
more features, I would use Redux as it's a mature state management tool that
I've used in a number of projects.
